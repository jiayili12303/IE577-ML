[![Run Unit Tests](https://github.com/jiayili12303/IE577-ML/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jiayili12303/IE577-ML/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

This repository contains a NumPy-based machine learning package implemented from scratch for **CMOR 438 / INDE 577: Data Science and Machine Learning**.

The project focuses on both algorithmic implementation and reproducible data science practice. It includes supervised learning algorithms, unsupervised learning algorithms, preprocessing utilities, evaluation metrics, unit tests, GitHub Actions continuous integration, and example notebooks.

## Project Goals

The goals of this project are to:

1. Implement core machine learning algorithms from scratch using NumPy.
2. Build a reusable Python package with a clean project structure.
3. Provide unit tests for correctness and reliability.
4. Use GitHub Actions to automatically run tests on every push.
5. Demonstrate each algorithm through Jupyter notebooks with data exploration, preprocessing, model fitting, evaluation, and interpretation.

## Package Overview

The package is organized into four main modules:

```python
jiayi_ml.preprocessing
jiayi_ml.metrics
jiayi_ml.supervised
jiayi_ml.unsupervised
```

### Preprocessing

The preprocessing module includes:

- `StandardScaler`
- `MinMaxScaler`

These classes follow a scikit-learn-like API:

```python
scaler.fit(X_train)
X_train_scaled = scaler.transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
```

### Metrics

The metrics module includes regression and classification metrics.

Regression metrics:

- `mean_squared_error`
- `root_mean_squared_error`
- `mean_absolute_error`
- `r2_score`

Classification metrics:

- `accuracy_score`
- `confusion_matrix`
- `precision_score`
- `recall_score`
- `f1_score`

## Example Usage

### Linear Regression

```python
import numpy as np
from jiayi_ml.supervised import LinearRegression

X = np.array([[0], [1], [2], [3]])
y = np.array([1, 3, 5, 7])

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

predictions = model.predict(X)
print(predictions)
```

6. Evaluation or interpretation
7. Discussion of results

9. Conclusion

## Dataset Choices

The notebooks use built-in datasets from `scikit-learn` and synthetic datasets generated with `sklearn.datasets`.

This choice improves reproducibility because the notebooks do not require external downloads or private datasets.

The examples are designed to connect algorithm behavior with interpretable data science questions:

- The Diabetes dataset is used for regression and regularization.
- The Breast Cancer dataset is used for binary classification, probabilistic classification, and dimensionality reduction.
- The Iris dataset is used for distance-based multiclass classification.
- The Wine dataset is used for tree-based classification and hierarchical clustering.
- Synthetic datasets are used when they provide clearer visualization of algorithm behavior.

## Development Practices

This repository follows several software engineering practices:

- Modular package structure under `src/`
- Reusable model classes with `fit`, `predict`, `fit_predict`, `transform`, or `score` methods
- NumPy-based algorithm implementations
- Docstrings for functions and classes
- Unit tests using `pytest`
- Continuous integration using GitHub Actions
- Project configuration through `pyproject.toml`

## Testing and Continuous Integration

The test suite covers:

- Package imports
- Preprocessing utilities
- Regression metrics
- Classification metrics
- Supervised learning algorithms
- Unsupervised learning algorithms
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Model behavior on simple known examples

GitHub Actions automatically runs the unit tests on every push and pull request using Python 3.11 and Python 3.12.

## Notes

This package is built for educational purposes. It prioritizes clarity, readability, and algorithmic understanding over production-level optimization.

The implementations are intended to demonstrate the core ideas behind machine learning algorithms rather than replace mature libraries such as scikit-learn.
